        <h1>Apple Pie by Grandma Ople</h1>
        <img src='applepie.jpeg'>
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is absolutely the best homemade apple pie you'll 
                ever make! It has a flaky, buttery crust and a tender,
                lightly-spiced apple pie filling. Use a combination of 
                apples for best flavor, and bake until the top is golden
                and the filling is bubbly!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>8 Granny Smith apples- peeled, cored and sliced</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F(220 degrees C). Melt the 
                    butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add 
                    water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. 
                    Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
                <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, 
                    mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently
                    pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour 
                    slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
                <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature
                    to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to
                    45 minutes, until apples are soft.
                </li>
            </ol>
