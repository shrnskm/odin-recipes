        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over
                    medium heat.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is simmering, add the chopped onion and
                    carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has 
                    softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder annd thyme. Cook until
                    fragrant while stirrng constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour
                    in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few minutes, 
                    stirring often, in order to enhance their flavo. </li>
                <li>Pour in lentils, broth and water. Add salt and red pepper
                    flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.
                    Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially
                    cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle 
                    simmer. Cook for 2 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are 
                    tender but still hold thier shape.</li>
                <li>Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender and puree until
                    smooth. Pour the pureed soup back into the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped greens and cook for 5 minutes, or until 
                    the greens have softened to your liking. Remove the pot from
                    the heat and stir in lemon juice. Taste and season with more 
                    salt, pepper and/or lemon juice to your liking.</li>
                <li>Serve while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days 
                    in the refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months.
